Creating my first legitimate Project :))

+ make the necessary files and folders and download required images forehand and shit
+ link the font awesome library to our project to use the icons using cdn built in tag for css
  (content delivery network: it links your shit to the closest server in order to make processes efficient)
+ we design the page stepwise from top to bottom
  1. the navbar at the topmost edge of the page
  2. the additional panel below the navbar
  3. the hero section
  4. the redirecting boxes section
  5. back to top panel above footer
  6. 3 levels of footer as per original website
+ we're gonna be giving div's more classes than ids since it's more efficient and professional that way
  using rem units instead of px contributes towards the responsiveness of the website on different devices
+ 7 individual boxes in the navbar (all coded simply and precisely, one by one )
+ cautiously rearrange elements inside flexbox, it's a very useful important property
+ it's all very easy once you go through it, just configuring a bunch of boxes, go for a more complicated website this time
